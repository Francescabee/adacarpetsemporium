# Refer to the README.md file in this project for a description 
# of the challenge and requirements. When viewing the README.md, 
# replit will show an option to Open Preview, which will open a 
# more readable view.

# The Python module math is imported and available to use but not required.
# Please do not import any additional modules (such as NumPy).

# import math

# def carpet_quote_estimator(room, carpet_type, options, promo_code):
    # pass

# You may call carpet_quote_estimator with your own arguments here.

def carpet_quote_estimator(room, carpet_type, options, promo_code)

# For example, if the following line is uncommented, and the Run button
# is clicked, it will call carpet_quote_estimator with the listed
# parameters. The supplied example uses the same arguments as the
# test Challenge01.
    
# carpet_quote_estimator([10, 10], "berber", ["delivery", "installation"], "")

# The challenges are provided as a set of tests that can be run 
# from the Tests panel at the left (the icon looks like a check 
# mark). Clicking the Run tests button will run the Challenge 
# inputs against your code, displaying either a success message, 
# or a message about what was expected and what was observed.

# After running the tests, it may be necessary to open a Console
# tab if the Test panel replaces it on the right side of the screen.
